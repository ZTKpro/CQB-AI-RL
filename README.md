# Machine Learning RL Sandbox

## Project Overview

Machine Learning RL Sandbox is a demonstration project created for exploring machine learning methods, with a particular focus on Reinforcement Learning (RL). It serves as a testing space, allowing easy experimentation with RL algorithms and the development of custom models in a safe and flexible environment.

## Key Features
- **RL Environment**: A simple and accessible environment for quick testing of RL algorithms, without the need for complex infrastructure.
- **Python Integration**: Python script enabling quick implementation and modification of machine learning algorithms.
- **Learning Examples**: Includes examples and templates for training models, ideal for both beginners and advanced users.
- **Flexible Testing Environment**: Allows modification of environment parameters and experimentation with various models and strategies.
- **Model Storage**: Models trained in the sandbox can be saved and loaded for further experiments, enabling continued work without starting from scratch.
- **Progress Visualization**: Supports visualization of training progress in graphical form, such as `learning_progress.png`, which helps track model performance.

## Project Structure

- **models/**: Directory where saved models are stored.

## Installation

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use

- **Running the Project**:
  ```sh
  python main.py
  ```
  After starting, you can begin experimenting with the provided examples or adjust parameters to suit your needs.

- **Examples**:
  Various ready-to-use examples for training RL models are available. The scripts are well-documented, making it easy to understand the training process and adapt it to your own projects.
